# proj5
In this project I have applied the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

Working in AWS
Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
Building pipelines
Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
Building Kubernetes clusters
Building Docker containers in pipelines

After creating a separate IAM user, create an ec2 t2.micro instance.
SSH into the instance and run the Jenkinsfile in EKS Cluster folder.
After that we can deploy our application in the ususal way.

I have followed the instructions provided by Alvaro Andres Pinzon Cortes in his medium blogs. So, thanks a lot to him.
